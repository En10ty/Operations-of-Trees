# Operations-of-Trees
The goal of this assignment is to practice with the operations of trees.
You are given an assignment4.cpp file. Create an empty project and include the given cpp file.

Your Tasks:
1.	Complete the function of int height(Node* root) that returns the height of a tree. 
2.	Complete the function of int size(Node* root) that returns the total number of nodes in the tree.
3.	Complete the bool isComplete(Node* root) that returns a Boolean value indicating whether the tree is a complete tree or not.
4.	Complete the void convert_BST(Node* root) that converts the given binary tree to a binary search tree, but maintain its original structure: The position of nodes in the tree does not change, but the keys in the nodes are changed to make it a binary search tree
